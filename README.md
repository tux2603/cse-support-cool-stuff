# cse-support-cool-stuff
Just a collection of cool stuff collected by the CSE Support team and other folks at Wright State 

## Contributing

For third party programs, just add a short description in this readme with a link to the download page. For particularly cool looking software, feel free to add a screenshot stored in the `screenshots/` directory.

For programs that you wrote put a short description in this readme file and then stick the source code et all in a nicely named directory in the root of the project. If you want to provide a long readme, put it in this directory. For any short little programs that you feel don't require their own separate directory, use the `quickLilPrograms/` directory. If you already have a GitHub repo for the project, feel free to set it up as a sub-module, just note that all submodules must be added using https, not ssh, and must be public. If you attempt to add a submodule using ssh or from a private repo it will cause a build failure, which isn't fun.

Just as a general rule of thumb, all software and tools here should be useful, interesting, or just fun. Insert the usual disclaimer about legality, academic integrity, and university policy.



## Third Party Software and Cool Things


### GitKraken

A nice GUI interface to git repositories for when you're too lazy to use the command line. The GitHub student pack includes free access to the pro suite. [Home page](https://www.gitkraken.com/)


### GitHub Student Pack

All sorts of cool free stuff for students, courtesy of GitHub. [Home page](https://education.github.com/pack)


### Linux

The recommended OS of the CSE Support Team. As a computer engineer or computer scientist, you should mess around with it at least once.  Find a list of popular distributions of Linux [here](https://distrowatch.com/)


### Singularity

Very useful containerization software that lets you set up and deploy complex development environments on any machine without having to worry about dependencies. [Home page](https://sylabs.io/)

Matt Kijowski has a useful guide for installing and running singularity in his [container-education GitHub repo](https://github.com/mkijowski/container-education)


### Termius

An SSH client for your smart phone. Free access to the premium version is available through the GitHub student pack. [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.server.auditor.ssh.client&hl=en), [Apple app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-ssh-shell-console-terminal/id549039908)


### The F\*\*\*

Command line tool that analyzes your last run command and tries to fix any possible typo. Very nice in general. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)


### VSCode

Cross platform programmer's text editor with all sorts of useful extensions and modules. Basically python of the IDE world. [Home page](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### You Should Use

Reminds you to use your aliases [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/paysonwallach/fish-you-should-use)


**TODO** find more cool stuff



## User Written Software and Cool Things


### Memory Chart

An interactive chart that displays a snapshot of system memory usage


### Owen's Utils

Mostly little tools and aliases for making life in bash easier, with a few cool utility programs thrown in


### Ryan's Utils

A collection of  all the short, but useful, little scripts Ryan uses on his Linux systems nearly every day. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodingPenguin1/Utils)


### Ryan's Dotfiles

Config files for Ryan's Arch/i3 desktop

### Facelocker

Uses your webcam to know when you walk away, automatically locking your Linux system.

### Game Drive Usage

Requires the [Plotly Python module](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/). Shows a nice pretty graph of how much space each of your game libraries is using, and each game in those libraries. You'll want to edit the main method to add your libraries. It should be pretty easy to figure out. Sorry, Ryan was really lazy and didn't add any sort of config file.
