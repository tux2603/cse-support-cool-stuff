## Third Party Software and Cool things

Useful and interesting pieces of software from various third party sources. All sorts of fun stuff, most of it free!

### GitKraken

A nice GUI interface to git repositories for when you're too lazy to use the command line. The GitHub student pack includes free access to the pro suite. [Home page](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

### GitHub Education Student Pack

All sorts of cool free stuff for students, courtesy of GitHub. [Home page](https://education.github.com/pack)

### Linux

The recommended OS of the CSE Support Team. As a computer engineer or computer scientist, you should mess around with it at least once.  Find a list of popular distributions of Linux [here](https://distrowatch.com/)

### Singularity

Very useful containerization software that lets you set up and deploy complex development environments on any machine without having to worry about dependencies. [Home page](https://sylabs.io/)

Matt Kijowski has a useful guide for installing and running singularity in his [container-education GitHub repo](https://github.com/mkijowski/container-education)

### Termius

An SSH client for your smart phone. Free access to the premium version is available through the GitHub student pack. [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.server.auditor.ssh.client&hl=en), [Apple app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-ssh-shell-console-terminal/id549039908)

### The F\*\*\*

Command line tool that analyzes your last run command and tries to fix any possible typo. Very nice in general. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)

### VSCode

Cross platform programmer's text editor with all sorts of useful extensions and modules. Basically python of the IDE world. [Home page](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### You Should Use

Reminds you to use your aliases [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/paysonwallach/fish-you-should-use)

## WSU Software and Cool Things

A collection of software written, maintained, or otherwise contributed to by WSU students, employees, and alumni. The perfect place to show off your pet project!

### Facelocker

Uses your webcam to know when you walk away, automatically locking your Linux system

### Game Drive Usage

Requires th.e [Plotly Python module](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/). Shows a nice pretty graph of how much space each of your game libraries is using, and each game in those libraries. You'll want to edit the main method to add your libraries. It should be pretty easy to figure out. Sorry, Ryan was really lazy and didn't add any sort of config file.


### Memory Chart

An interactive chart that displays a snapshot of system memory usage. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tux2603/memoryChart)

### Owen's Utils

Mostly little tools and aliases for making life in bash easier, with a few cool utility programs thrown in. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tux2603/QuickLittleUtils)

### Ryan's Dotfiles

Config files for Ryan's Arch/i3 desktop, as well as a demo of git bare repos. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodingPenguin1/dotfiles)

### Ryan's Utils

A collection of  all the short, but useful, little scripts Ryan uses on his Linux systems nearly every day. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodingPenguin1/Utils)
